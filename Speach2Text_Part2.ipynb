            "[06:15.960 --> 06:17.360]  basically is what I say.\n",
            "[06:17.360 --> 06:20.000]  Then I use the application object,\n",

            "[06:46.720 --> 06:48.840]  As you can see, it looks pretty similar.\n",
            "[06:48.840 --> 06:52.640]  It's simply once the workbook open,\n",
            "[06:52.640 --> 06:55.280]  it will fire this routine so the timer starts,\n",
            "[06:55.280 --> 06:59.320]  and then it's going to call this particular macro the first time.\n",
            "[06:59.320 --> 07:04.560]  After that, this macro is going to keep calling itself every 20 seconds.\n",

            "[07:07.560 --> 07:09.960]  Of course, you can change this to whatever you want it to be.\n",

            "[07:28.000 --> 07:30.280]  Here it is. I select this.\n",
            "[07:30.280 --> 07:35.640]  I know it's wrong. I notice I did a mistake.\n",
            "[07:35.640 --> 07:37.840]  I should not have included this option explicit\n",
            "[07:37.840 --> 07:39.880]  because now it wants me to declare the variable,\n",
            "[07:39.880 --> 07:42.720]  so I don't want to do that. Let me remove that.\n",
            "[07:42.720 --> 07:44.520]  Now if you want to do this correct,\n",
            "[07:44.520 --> 07:46.800]  you need to figure out what kind of object this is\n",
            "[07:46.800 --> 07:49.840]  and do it then up here in order to do it.\n",
            "[07:49.840 --> 07:52.160]  But for the sake of saving some time here,\n",
            "[07:52.160 --> 07:53.640]  I'm just going to remove this.\n",
            "[07:53.640 --> 07:56.960]  Let me save that. Let me get out.\n",
            "[07:56.960 --> 08:02.120]  Let me save the workbook again and then close it and open it one more time.\n",
            "[08:02.120 --> 08:05.240]  I'm opening it up. There it goes.\n",
            "[08:05.240 --> 08:07.000]  You can see here's the timestamp.\n",
            "[08:07.000 --> 08:10.320]  It's 1,128.55, so keep\n",
            "[08:10.320 --> 08:13.760]  an eye on that timestamp and keep an eye on this current price here.\n",
            "[08:13.760 --> 08:16.120]  In 20 seconds, it's going to run again.\n",
            "[08:16.120 --> 08:17.840]  There it went. As you can see,\n",
            "[08:17.840 --> 08:20.120]  now it changed to 1,129.15.\n",
            "[08:20.120 --> 08:22.560]  As you can see, you can add to this.\n",
            "[08:22.560 --> 08:25.680]  You can add like an icon set and conditional formatting.\n",
            "[08:25.680 --> 08:29.760]  For example, we could go in here on this profit maybe.\n",
            "[08:29.760 --> 08:32.400]  We can do a conditional formatting.\n",
            "[08:32.400 --> 08:34.920]  Maybe we want to use icon set.\n",
            "[08:34.920 --> 08:38.120]  Let's say I choose these three shapes here.\n",
            "[08:38.120 --> 08:41.800]  Let me see if Manage Rules.\n",
            "[08:41.800 --> 08:46.040]  What I want to do is I want to edit this rule and I might want to say,\n",
            "[08:46.040 --> 08:48.560]  first of all, let's make this numbers.\n",
            "[08:48.560 --> 08:52.280]  What I want to say if it's greater than zero,\n",
            "[08:52.280 --> 08:53.960]  then I want it to be green.\n",
            "[08:53.960 --> 08:56.640]  If it's greater or equal to zero,\n",
            "[08:56.640 --> 08:58.760]  meaning if it is zero,\n",
            "[08:58.760 --> 08:59.800]  it becomes the yellow one.\n",
            "[08:59.800 --> 09:01.960]  If it's less than zero, it becomes red.\n",
            "[09:01.960 --> 09:05.840]  Let's apply that and say,\n",
            "[09:05.840 --> 09:11.320]  okay, and let's copy this across all of this.\n",
            "[09:11.320 --> 09:15.400]  Right now, it all seems to be positive.\n",
            "[09:15.400 --> 09:17.960]  Let me change the purchase price maybe on this one.\n",
            "[09:17.960 --> 09:21.440]  Let's make this 1,350 or something.\n",
            "[09:21.440 --> 09:23.760]  As you can see now, it went red.\n",
            "[09:23.760 --> 09:27.120]  Yeah, so you can apply a conditional formatting as well here.\n",
            "[09:27.120 --> 09:29.400]  That's how this one works.\n",
            "[09:29.400 --> 09:32.080]  As you can see, it keeps updating every 20 seconds.\n",
